Kitching et al. (2016) examine the impact of four approximations that can be used when constraining cosmological parameters from the measurement of weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structures, also known as cosmic shear.  We support the core important message of this paper that such approximations should not be used for the future analysis of high precision surveys such as Euclid, LSST and WFIRST.  In this comment, we argue that these approximations are not able to explain away the tension between the constraints from some current weak lensing surveys and Planck.  Reducing uncertainty and characterising bias and in photometric redshift estimation is certainly a crucial task for the success of current and future surveys.  We highlight that sophisticated treatments of these uncertainties have already been explored in the literature and have been shown not to resolve the tension with Planck, in contrast to the message that Kitching et al. (2016) convey.

\section{Introduction}

The measurement of weak gravitational lensing by large scale structures provides a powerful cosmological probe of dark matter, dark energy and modifications to gravity.  As such it is the primary science goal of several current (KiDS, HSC, DES) and future (Euclid, LSST, WFIRST) large-scale surveys.   Interest in the results from these surveys is high as statistically significant tensions have been found between the cosmological parameter constraints from the CMB Planck experiment \citep{planck/cosmo:2015} in comparison to weak lensing constraints from both the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS).  If the source of this tension is not a result of so-far unconsidered sources of systematic errors in one or all experiments, extensions to the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological need to be considered.  \citet{joudaki/etal:2017} have shown, for example, that the tension can be resolved with an evolving dark energy model.

In this comment paper we discuss four approximations that can be used when deriving theoretical predictions for the principally used cosmic shear statistic, $\xi_\pm$, the two-point shear correlation function.   These approximations have been explored in (ADD REF) and most recently highlighted by \citet{kitching/etal:2016} as a way to reduce tensions between weak lensing and CMB experiments, focusing on a re-analysis of the non-tomographic weak lensing data from the CFHTLenS survey \citet{kilbinger/etal:2013}.    In section~\ref{sec:cfhtlens} we compare the `one-parameter' cosmological re-analysis of \citet{kitching/etal:2016} with the full six-parameter analysis by \citet{kilbinger/etal:2013}, arguing that this particular non-tomographic data set is not in significant tension with Planck.  We also briefly review the literature that has advanced our understanding since the original CFHTLenS analyses were published.  In section~\ref{sec:theory} we clarify that only one/two? of the approximations highlighted by \citet{kitching/etal:2016} have actually been used in recent weak lensing analyses \citet{joudaki/etal:2016, hildebrandt/etal:2016, joudaki/etal:2017} and discuss why we do not expect these approximations to impact on the cosmological analysis of these surveys.    Finally in section~\ref{sec:photoz} we review our current knowledge of photometric redshift uncertainties and the sophisticated mitigation strategies that have already been applied to data from CFHTLenS, DES and KiDS.  We suggest that a possible misinterpretation in the direction of the redshift biases reported in \citet{choi/etal:2016} has lead to the incorrect conclusion of \citet{kitching/etal:2016} that these redshift biases can resolve the tension with Planck.  

%-the analysis in the Kitching et al paper is fine, but the approximations used are not able to explain away the tension with Planck results, in contrast to the message the paper conveys.
%- we have verified that current (KiDS450) analyses are barely affected because they are restricted to larger scales
%- the CFHTLenS analysis used as an example has larger errors than the marginal error quoted in Kitching et al, and deviates less from Planck than most other results
%- the Limber and flat-sky approximations barely move this data point, so do not resolve even this tension
%- the discussion on photo-z uncertainties, where the uncertainty is characterized by a simple shift in the mean, is oversimplified and does not apply to more sophisticated treatment as used in latest results
