@article{Koehlinger2016,
abstract = {We measure the weak gravitational lensing shear power spectra and their cross-power in two photometric redshift bins from the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). The measurements are performed directly in multipole space in terms of adjustable band powers. For the extraction of the band powers from the data we have implemented and extended a quadratic estimator, a maximum likelihood method that allows us to readily take into account irregular survey geometries, masks, and varying sampling densities. We find the 68 per cent credible intervals in the $\sigma$8–$\Omega$m plane to be marginally consistent with results from Planck for a simple five-parameter $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. For the projected parameter S8 ≡ $\sigma$8($\Omega$m/0.3)0.5 we obtain a best-fitting value of S8=0.768+0.045−0.039S{\_}8 = 0.768{\_}{\{}-0.039{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.045{\}}. This constraint is consistent with results from other CFHTLenS studies as well as the Dark Energy Survey. Our most conservative model, including modifications to the power spectrum due to baryon feedback and marginalization over photometric redshift errors, yields an upper limit on the total mass of three degenerate massive neutrinos of $\Sigma$m$\nu$ {\textless} 4.53 eV at 95 per cent credibility, while a Bayesian model comparison does not favour any model extension beyond a simple five-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model. Combining the shear likelihood with Planck breaks the $\sigma$8–$\Omega$m degeneracy and yields $\sigma$8 = 0.818 ± 0.013 and $\Omega$m = 0.300 ± 0.011 which is fully consistent with results from Planck alone.},

abstract = {In this paper we discuss the commonly-used approximations for two-point cosmic shear statistics. We discuss the four most prominent assumptions in this statistic: the flat-sky, tomographic, Limber and configuration-space approximations, that the vast majority of cosmic shear results to date have used simultaneously. Of these approximations we find that the flat-sky approximation suppresses power by {\textgreater}1{\%} on scales of l{\textless}100 and the standard Limber approximation implementation enhances power by {\textgreater}5{\%} on scales l{\textless}100; in doing so we find an l-dependent factor that has been neglected in analyses to date. To investigate the impact of these approximations we reanalyse the CFHTLenS 2D correlation function results. When using all approximations we reproduce the result that measurements of the matter power spectrum amplitude are in tension with measurements from the CMB Planck data: where a conditional value of sigma8=0.789 +/- 0.015 is found from CFHTLenS and sigma8=0.830 +/- 0.015 from Planck. When we do not use the Limber and flat-sky approximations we find a conditional value of sigma8=0.801 +/- 0.016 from the CFHTLenS data, significantly reducing the tension between Planck CMB results and lensing results from CFHTLenS. When including the additional effect of expected photometric redshift biases we find sigma8=0.839 +/- 0.017 which is consistent with Planck. We also discuss the impact on CMB lensing. For Euclid, LSST, and WFIRST and any current or future survey none of these approximations should be used.},

abstract = {We develop a method for estimating the shear power spectra from weak-lensing observations and test it on simulated data. Our method describes the shear field in terms of angular power spectra and the cross-correlation of the two shear modes, which differ under parity transformations. Two of the three power spectra can be used to monitor unknown sources of noise in the data. The power spectra are decomposed in a model-independent manner in terms of ``band powers,'' which are then extracted from the data using a quadratic estimator to find the maximum of the likelihood and its local curvature (for error estimates). We test the method against simulated data from Gaussian realizations and cosmological N-body simulations. In the Gaussian case, the mean band powers and their covariance are well recovered even for irregular (or sparsely) sampled fields. The mild non-Gaussianity of the N-body realizations causes a slight underestimation of the errors that becomes negligible for scales much larger than several arcminutes and does not bias the recovered band powers. These techniques can also be directly applied to cosmic microwave background polarization E and B mode analyses on small fields.},

abstract = {We present our cosmic shear analysis of GEMS, one of the largest wide-field surveys ever undertaken by the Hubble Space Telescope. Imaged with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), GEMS spans 795
arcmin2 in the Chandra Deep Field South. We detect weak lensing by large-scale structure in high-resolution F606W GEMS data from {\~{}}60 resolved galaxies per square arcminute. We measure the two-point shear correlation function, the top-hat shear variance and the shear power spectrum, performing an E/B mode decomposition for each statistic. We show that we are not limited by systematic errors and use our results to place joint constraints on the matter density parameter
$\Omega$m and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum
$\sigma$8. We find
$\sigma$8($\Omega$m/0.3)0.65= 0.68 +/-
0.13 where the 1$\sigma$ error includes both our uncertainty on the
median redshift of the survey and sampling variance.

Removing image and point spread function (PSF) distortions are crucial to all weak lensing analyses. We therefore include a thorough discussion on the degree of ACS PSF distortion and anisotropy which we characterize directly from GEMS data. Consecutively imaged over 20 d, GEMS data also allow us to investigate PSF instability over time. We find that, even in the relatively short GEMS observing period, the ACS PSF ellipticity varies at the level of a few per cent which we account for with a semi-time-dependent PSF model. Our correction for the temporal and spatial variability of the PSF is shown to be successful through a series of diagnostic tests.},

abstract = {We perform a statistical weak lensing or `cosmic shear' analysis of the COMBO-17 survey - a unique data set with shear quality R-band imaging and accurate photometric redshift estimates ($\sigma$z= 0.05) for {\~{}}90 per cent of galaxies to mR{\textless}= 24.0. We undertake a full maximum likelihood analysis to measure directly from the data the weak lensing power spectra, C$\kappa$$\kappa$l,
C$\beta$$\beta$l and
C$\kappa$$\beta$l in five band powers from l= 400 to
l= 104, where $\kappa$ is the usual lens convergence and
$\beta$ is an odd-parity `curl' component of the shear signal. We find a strong measurement of the convergence power over five fields. The non-gravitational $\beta$-field has a much lower significance, indicating our data are free of major systematics, while the cross-correlation of $\kappa$ and $\beta$ is consistent with zero. We have also calculated the
shear correlation functions and variance over a range of scales between 0.5 and 20 arcmin. Our measurements of minimal star-galaxy correlations and cross-correlations between galaxy components provide further evidence that any systematics are negligible.

In addition, we have used our results to measure cosmological
parameters, constraining the normalization of the matter power spectrum to be $\sigma$8= (0.72 +/-
0.09)($\Omega$m/0.3)-0.49, where the errors quoted are 1$\sigma$ due to the intrinsic dispersion in galaxy ellipticities,
cosmic and sampling variance. We have significantly reduced the usual additional uncertainty in the median redshift (zm) of the source galaxies by estimating zm directly from our data using accurate photometric redshift information from the COMBO-17 multi-band wide-field survey. To demonstrate the power of accurate redshift information, we have also measured parameters from a shear analysis of only those galaxies for which accurate redshift estimates are available. In this case, we have eliminated the uncertainty in the redshift distribution of sources and we show that the uncertainties in the resulting parameter constraints are reduced by more than a factor of 2 compared with the typical uncertainties found in cosmic shear surveys to date. Finally, we combine our parameter measurements with constraints from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey and with those from the cosmic microwave background. With these additional constraints, we measure the normalization of the matter power spectrum to be $\sigma$8=
0.73+0.06-0.03 and the matter density of the Universe to be $\Omega$m=
0.27+0.02-0.01.},

@article{Lin2012,
abstract = {Stripe 82 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey was observed multiple times, allowing deeper images to be constructed by co-adding the data. Here, we analyze the ellipticities of background galaxies in this 275 deg2 region, searching for evidence of distortions due to cosmic shear. We do so using measurements of both the shear-shear correlation function and power spectrum, with the latter determined using both "quadratic" and "pseudo" estimation techniques. We show how we verified these methods using mock catalogs. We also describe our methods for modeling and correcting for the effects of the point-spread function ({\{}PSF{\}}) in our shape measurements, and we also describe our prescription for estimating photometric redshifts (photo-z's) for our galaxy sample. In particular, we assess the impact of potential systematic effects due to the {\{}PSF{\}} and to photo-z's, and show that these are under control in our analysis. We find consistent correlation function and power spectrum results, where the E-mode cosmic shear signal is detected in both real and Fourier space with {\{}{\textgreater}{\}}5$\sigma$
significance on degree scales, while the B-mode is consistent with zero as expected. The amplitude of the signal constrains the combination of the matter density $\Omega$ m and fluctuation amplitude $\sigma$8 to be $\Omega$0.7 m
$\sigma$8 = 0.252+0.032 -
0.052.},

@article{Seljak1998,
abstract = {Large-scale structure distorts the images of background galaxies, which 
allows one to measure directly the projected distribution of dark matter
in the universe and determine its power spectrum. Here we address the
question of how to extract this information from the observations. We
derive minimum variance estimators for the projected density
reconstruction and its power spectrum and apply them to simulated data
sets, showing that they give a good agreement with the theoretical
minimum variance expectations. The same estimator can also be applied to
the cluster reconstruction, where it remains a useful reconstruction
technique, although it is no longer optimal for every application. The
method can be generalized to include nonlinear cluster reconstruction
and photometric information on redshifts of background galaxies in the
analysis. We also address the question of how to obtain directly the
three-dimensional power spectrum from the weak lensing data. We derive a
minimum variance quadratic estimator, which maximizes the likelihood
function for the three-dimensional power spectrum and can be computed
either from the measurements directly or from the two-dimensional power
spectrum. The estimator correctly propagates the errors and provides a
full correlation matrix of the estimates. It can be generalized to the
case where redshift distribution depends on the galaxy photometric
properties, which allows one to measure both the three-dimensional power
spectrum and its time evolution.},

@article{Bond1998,
abstract = {We develop two methods for estimating the power spectrum, Cl, of the cosmic microwave background from data and apply them to the Cosmic Background Explorer Differential Microwave Radiometer and Saskatoon datasets. One method involves a direct evaluation of the likelihood function, and the other is an estimator that is a
minimum-variance weighted quadratic function of the data. Applied iteratively, the quadratic estimator is not distinct from likelihood analysis, but is rather a rapid means of finding the power spectrum that maximizes the likelihood function. Our results bear this out: direct evaluation and quadratic estimation converge to the same Cls. The quadratic estimator can also be used to determine directly
cosmological parameters and their uncertainties. While the two methods both require O(N3) operations, the quadratic is much faster, and both are applicable to datasets with arbitrary chopping patterns and noise correlations. We also discuss approximations that may reduce it to O(N2) thus making it practical for forthcoming megapixel datasets.},
