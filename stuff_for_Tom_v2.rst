General
------- 

        - No acknowlegement to our team! Even though their updates
          were clearly influenced by the comment draft and have improved.
          E.g. the discussion talks about the Bernardeau et al. paper,
          absent in v1.

        - no mention that current results are unaffected by those approximations.

Sect. 2.3
---------

        - Correlation function using Wigner small-d matrices?? No equation,
          no reference, just "can be derived starting from there", or:
          "... can be derived ... from the additive properties of the Wigner
          large-D matrices."!

page 4
------
        - "To estimate correlation functions from data formally requires summing
          over all galaxy pairs separated by arbitrary angles from zero seperation to infinity".
          Wrong statement. Could actually not be more wrong.

Sect. 3.4
---------
        - Full case is not more computationally demanding than the approximate cases: That is
          not what I found, the full projection is a 3D integral compared to the 1D Limber one.
          It would be interesting to  compare the best Limber-case (ExtL1Sph) to the full case.

Discussion
----------

        - Claim that Giannantonio neglect a factor l^4?
          So for say l=100 they are wrong by 10^*???

          Approximating l = k chi solves this issue (modulo
          the wrong factor of chi in their lensing efficiency.

          And what is "weighted galaxy-clustering projected C(l)"?
          C(l) for galaxy clustering? G+12 eq (25) is clearly the
          lensing efficiency kernel.

          "Single redshift": Wrong, just look at eq (18) and Fig. 2.

        - Jeong et al. (2009), "partly consistent" with v2. Have to
          check that out.

        - Bernardeau et al. (2012) [reference missing in bib list].
          Wrong interpretation of their eq. (44). The k^2 instead of k^{-2}
          is due to their
          P(k) being the potential power spectrum, not the matter one. 
          Cf. our eqs. (9) and (10).
          Their sentence "where a factor k2 de- notes that the power spectrum
          rather than the Newtonian potential is being probed" is non-sensical.
          This does *not* correspond to the projected galaxy power spectrum, just
          one equation above there is the lensing efficiency again!!
