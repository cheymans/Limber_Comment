In this comment we have highlighted a number of shortcomings in the analysis presented in \cite{kitching/etal:2016}.  We argue that the flat sky and Limber approximations that can be used in cosmic shear analyses are not able to explain away the tension between current weak lensing and Planck results, in contrast to the message that \cite{kitching/etal:2016} convey.  Our critique should not, however, detract from the extremely important core message of their paper, that future surveys will need to carefully consider these approximations and optimise their statistical analyses accordingly.  For example moving from the standard two-point shear correlation function statistic to the more stringent `COSEBI' statistic renders the cosmic shear measurement completely insensitive to the low-$\ell$ scales where these approximations become important \citep{schneider/etal:2010}.
