In this comment we have highlighted a number of shortcomings in the analysis presented in \cite{kitching/etal:2016}.  We argue that the flat sky and Limber approximations that can be used in cosmic shear analyses are not able to explain away the tension between current weak lensing and Planck results, in contrast to the message that \cite{kitching/etal:2016} convey.  Our critique should not, however, detract from the important core message of their paper, that future surveys will need to consider these approximations and optimise their statistical analyses accordingly (\shahab{I think we are being too nice, it's unclear the Limber and flat-sky approximations are important even for future surveys when considered together --- moreover Tommaso's paper seems to suggest Limber approximation fine even for future surveys}).  For example moving from the standard two-point shear correlation function statistic to the more stringent `COSEBI' statistic \citep{schneider/etal:2010} renders the cosmic shear measurement completely insensitive to the low-$\ell$ scales where these approximations become important.  

\blue{The treatment of photo-$z$ uncertainties in \cite{kitching/etal:2016} is based on a simple linear shift of redshift distributions. This has been shown to be insufficient to capture the full complexity of the problem. More importantly though, it seems like \cite{kitching/etal:2016} apply the photo-$z$ calibrations from \cite{choi/etal:2016} in the wrong direction. Instead of alleviating the tension between CFHTLenS and Planck a correct application of the offsets would increase the discrepancy, in agreement with a recent re-analysis of the CFHTLenS data \citep{joudaki/etal:2016} as well as results from the KiDS project \citep{hildebrandt/etal:2016}.}
