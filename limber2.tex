\begin{abstract}

We compute the spherical-sky weak-lensing power spectrum of the shear and
convergence. We discuss various approximations, such as flat-sky, first- and
second-order Limber equations for the projection. We find that the impact of adopting 
these approximations are negligible when constraining cosmological parameters from 
current weak lensing surveys.
This is demonstrated using data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). 
We find that the reported tension with Planck CMB temperature anisotropy results cannot be alleviated, in
contrast to the recent claim made by \citet{2016arXiv161104954K}. 
For future large-scale surveys with unprecedented precision, we show that the spherical
second-order Limber approximation will provide sufficient accuracy, as it is in 
agreement with the full projection at the percent level for $\ell > 3$.  
In the spirit of reproducible research, our numerical implementation of all approximations
and the full projection are publicly available within the package
\textsc{nicaea} at \texttt{http://www.cosmostat.org/software/nicaea}.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The measurement of weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structures
provides a powerful cosmological probe of dark matter, dark energy, and
modifications to gravity.  As such it is the primary science goal of several
current (KiDS, DES, HSC\footnote{KiDS: \href={http://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl}, DES: \href={http://www.darkenergysurvey.org}, HSC: \href={http://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/}})
and future (Euclid, LSST, WFIRST\footnote{Euclid: \href={http://sci.esa.int/euclid}, LSST: \href={http://www.lsst.org}, WFIRST: \href={http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov}}) surveys.
%(Kilo-Degree Survey, KiDS \citet{kuijken/etal:2015}, Dark Energy Survey, DES, \citet{abbott/etal:2016}, Hyper-Suprime Camera Survey, HSC\footnote{HSC; \href={http://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/}}) and future (Euclid, \citet{2011arXiv1110.3193L}, LSST, \citet{chang/etal:2013}, WFIRST\footnote{WFIRST; \href={http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov}}) large-scale surveys.
Interest in the results from these surveys is high as statistically significant
deviations have been found between the cosmological parameter constraints from
the CMB Planck experiment \citep{2015arXiv150201589P} in comparison to weak
lensing constraints from both the Kilo-Degree Survey \citep[KiDS;][]{KiDS-450}
and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey
\citep[CFHTLenS;][]{joudaki/etal:2016}.  If the source of this tension is not
a result of so-far unconsidered sources of systematic errors in one or all
experiments, extensions to the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological models
need to be considered. \citet{joudaki/etal:2017} have shown, for example, that
the tension can be resolved with an evolving dark energy model.

In the era of the upcoming large-scale surveys that will provide measurements of
cosmic shear with unprecedented precision, one needs to revisit the theoretical
predictions of the observables to ensure that the accuracy of the
models meet the accuracy of the upcoming data. In this paper, we examine the widely used Limber
approximation for the projected weak-lensing power spectrum. We consider
spherical coordinates and the flat-sky approximation, and compute the full
projection as well as first- and second-order Limber approximation. We show
that the second-order Limber approximation is an accurate representation of the full projection, with better than percent level precision for scale $\ell > 3$. 
Since this approximation involves only 1D integrals over the matter power spectrum, it is very fast to
calculate numerically and can readily employed in Monte-Carlo sampling methods
to obtain precision constraints on cosmological parameters.

This paper is organised as follows.  In section~\ref{sec:wl} we provide a pedagogical introduction to weak gravitational lensing theory, projections and power spectra for the flat-sky and spherical cases.  In section~\ref{sec:L2} we derive weak lensing observables using a second-order limber approximation first introduced by \citet{2008PhRvD..78l3506L}.  We compare the shear power spectrum and commonly-used two-point shear correlation function for the full solution to a range of different approximations in section~\ref{sec:comp}, providing cosmological constraints for each case using CFHTLenS data from \citet{CFHTLenS-2pt-notomo} in section~\ref{sec:cfhtlens}.  This paper draws from several sources of literature which have previously reviewed the accuracy of the Limber approximation for weak lensing studies, namely \citet{2008PhRvD..78d3002S,2012PhRvD..86b3001B, 2012MNRAS.422.2854G, 2016arXiv161104954K}.   We present a discussion and comparison of our results to these papers in Appendix~\ref{app:B}.

\section{Weak-lensing projections and power spectra}
\label{sec:wl}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section we review the basic weak-lensing projection expressions, and
compute lensing power spectra for a spherical case, and in the flat-sky
approximation. For completeness we provide a derivations of the weak lensing power spectra in Appendix~\ref{sec:derivations_C}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The lensing potential}
\label{sec:psi}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


The lensing potential $\psi$ in the Born approximation is defined as the
projected 3D metric potential $\Phi$ along the line of sight
\citep{1998ApJ...498...26K,BS01},
%
% Hu00 (21,22) with minus sign
%
\begin{equation}
  \psi(\theta, \varphi) = \frac 2 {{\rm c}^2} \int_0^{\chi_{\rm lim}} \frac{{\rm d}\chi}{\chi}
    \Phi[\chi, f_K(\chi) \theta, f_K(\chi) \varphi; \chi] \, q(\chi),
  \label{eq:psi}
\end{equation}
%
where the lensing efficiency $q$ is given by
%
\begin{equation}
  q(\chi) = \int\limits_\chi^{\chi_{\rm lim}} {\rm d} \chi^\prime \, n(\chi^\prime)
    \frac{f_K(\chi^\prime - \chi)}{f_K(\chi^\prime)},
  %
  \label{eq:lens_efficiency}
\end{equation}
%
corresponding to a population of lensed galaxies with normalised source redshift
distribution $n(z) {\rm d}z = n(\chi) {\rm d} \chi$. Here, ${\rm c}$ is the
speed of light, the projection is carried out over comoving distances $\chi$ up
to a limiting distance $\chi_{\rm lim}$, and $f_K$ is the the comoving angular
distance, which depend on the spatial curvature of the Universe $K$.
%
This assumes a homogeneous galaxy distribution without clustering, so that the
redshift distribution in this approximation does not depend on the position
$(\theta, \varphi)$. Accounting for this position dependence leads to
correction of weak-lensing quantities due to clustering of source galaxies with
other sources \citep{2002A&A...389..729S}, and with galaxies associated with
lens structures \citep{1998A&A...338..375B,H02}.

The 3D potential is related to the density contrast $\delta$ via the Poisson
equation. Assuming General Relativity, this relation is written in Fourier space as
%
\begin{align}
  \hat \Phi(\vec k; \chi) = & - \frac 3 2 \Omega_{\rm m} H_0^2 k^{-2} a^{-1}(\chi) \hat \delta(\vec k; \chi),
      \label{eq:poisson}
\end{align}
%
where $\Omega_{\rm m}$ is the matter density parameter, $H_0$ the Hubble constant, $\vec k$ a 3D Fourier wave
vector, and $a$ the scale factor with $a=1$ today.
The Fourier transform of the potential and its inverse are defined as
%
\begin{align}
  \hat \Phi(\vec k; \chi) = &  \int {\rm d}^3 r \, \Phi(\vec r; \chi) {\rm e}^{{\rm i} \vec k \vec r} .
  \label{eq:hatPhi}
  \\
  \Phi(\vec r; \chi) = &  \int \frac{{\rm d}^3 k}{(2\pi)^3}
      \hat \Phi(\vec k; \chi) {\rm e}^{-{\rm i} \vec r \vec k},
  \label{eq:hatPhi_inv}
\end{align}
%
where the integration range for both integrals is $\mathbb{R}^3$.

\subsection{Lensing power spectra in the spherical case}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Lensing potential power spectrum}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Following \cite{2000PhRvD..62d3007H} we decompose the lensing potential
(\ref{eq:psi}) into a spherical harmonics expansion, in analogy of CMB
temperature, both of which are scalar functions on the sphere. This
decomposition and its inverse are
%
% Hu00 (23)
%
\begin{align}
  \psi(\theta, \varphi) = \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell \psi_{\ell m} {\rm Y}_{\ell m}(\theta, \varphi);
    \label{eq:psi_harm_exp}
    \\
    %
  \psi_{\ell m} = \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} {\rm d} \Omega \, \psi(\theta, \varphi) {\rm Y}^\ast_{\ell m}(\theta, \varphi).
  \label{eq:psi_harm_exp_inv}
\end{align}

To specify tomographic redshift bins $i=0\ldots N_z-1$, we introduce a family
of lensing efficiency functions $q_i$ defined by a corresponding family of
redshift distributions $n_i$ via eq.~(\ref{eq:lens_efficiency}). The resulting
lensing potential is denoted by $\psi_{\ell m, i}$. The tomographic power
spectrum of the lensing potential between two redshift bins $i$ and $j$,
$C_{ij}^\psi$ is then defined by \cite{pee80}
%
\begin{equation}
  \left\langle \psi^{}_{\ell m, i} \, \psi^\ast_{\ell^\prime m^\prime, j} \right\rangle
    = \delta_{\ell \ell^\prime} \delta_{m m^\prime} C^\psi_{ij}(\ell) .
  \label{eq:C_ell_psi}
\end{equation}
%
Using the properties of the spherical harmonics (see
App.~\ref{sec:derivations_C} for details) the power spectrum can be written as
%
\begin{align}
  C_{ij}^\psi(\ell) = & \frac 8 {c^4 \pi} 
  \int_0^{\chi_{\rm lim}} \frac{{\rm d}\chi}{\chi} q_i(\chi)
  \int_0^{\chi^\prime_{\rm lim}} \frac{{\rm d}\chi^\prime}{\chi^\prime} q_j(\chi^\prime)
  \int {\rm d} k k^2 \, {\rm j}_\ell(k \chi) {\rm j}_\ell(k \chi^\prime) P_\Phi(k; \chi, \chi^\prime)
  \label{eq:C_ell_phi_Pphi} \\
  = & \frac 8 \pi \pref^2
  \int_0^{\chi_{\rm lim}} \frac{{\rm d}\chi}{\chi} \frac{q_i(\chi)}{a(\chi)}
  \int_0^{\chi^\prime_{\rm lim}} \frac{{\rm d}\chi^\prime}{\chi^\prime} \frac{q_j(\chi^\prime)}{a(\chi^\prime)}
  \int \frac{{\rm d} k}{k^2} \, {\rm j}_\ell(k \chi) {\rm j}_\ell(k \chi^\prime) P_{\rm m}(k; \chi, \chi^\prime) ;
  \label{eq:C_ell_phi_Pm}
\end{align}
%
where ${\rm j}_\ell$ it the spherical Bessel function of order $\ell$. For
convenience we defined the normalisation constant $\pref$ as
%
\begin{equation}
  \pref = \frac 3 2 \Omega_{\rm m} \left(\frac{H_0} c\right)^2.
  \label{eq:pref}
\end{equation}
%
The first line expresses $C_{ij}^\psi$ in terms of the 3D potential power spectrum $P_\Phi$, defined as
%
\begin{align}
  \left\langle \hat \Phi(\vec k; \chi) \hat \Phi^\ast(\vec k^\prime; \chi^\prime) \right\rangle
    = & (2\pi)^3 \delta_{\rm D}(\vec k - \vec k^\prime) P_\Phi(k; \chi, \chi^\prime).
    %\nonumber \\
    %= & (2\pi)^3 \delta_{\rm D}(\vec k - \vec k^\prime) \pref^2 k^{-4} a^{-1}(\chi) a^{-1}(\chi^\prime)
      %P_{\rm m}(k; \chi, \chi^\prime).
  \label{eq:p_phi}
\end{align}
%
The second line uses the 3D matter density power spectrum $P_{\rm m}$, which is defined analogously as
%
\begin{align}
  \left\langle \hat \delta(\vec k; \chi) \hat \delta^\ast(\vec k^\prime; \chi^\prime) \right\rangle
    = & (2\pi)^3 \delta_{\rm D}(\vec k - \vec k^\prime) P_{\rm m}(k; \chi, \chi^\prime),
  \label{eq:p_m}
\end{align}
%
and is
related to $P_\Phi$ via the absolute square of the Poisson equation (\ref{eq:poisson}).


In the following section we will discuss the relations between of shear and
convergence to the lensing potential on the sphere, and derive the power
spectrum of the former two fields.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Shear power spectrum}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The shear $\gamma = \gamma_1 + {\rm i} \gamma_2$ is related to the potential at
linear order by the trace-free part of the Jacobi matrix. The involved
differential operator on the sphere is called \emph{edth} derivative, $\edth$,
see \cite{2005PhRvD..72b3516C} for a in-depth mathematical discussion of this
concept. The edth operator $\edth$ ($\edth^\ast$) raises (lowers) the spin $s$
of an object. Twice applying this operator to the scalar (spin-0) potential
creates the spin-2 shear:
%
\begin{align}
  \gamma(\theta, \varphi) = & \frac 1 2 \edth \edth \psi(\theta, \varphi).
    \nonumber \\
  \gamma^\ast(\theta, \varphi) = & \frac 1 2 \edth^\ast \edth^\ast \psi(\theta, \varphi).
  \label{gamma_psi_spher}
\end{align}
%
To write the shear on the sphere in terms of the lensing potential $\psi$, we
insert the harmonics expansion of the potential (\ref{eq:psi_harm_exp}). This
requires to compute second derivatives of the spherical harmonic functions.
This opereration defines a new object, the \emph{spin-weighted spherical
harmonic} $_s{\rm Y}_{\ell m}$. The shear can be written on the sphere in terms
of these functions as a spherical harmonics multipole expansion with
coefficients $_{\pm 2} \gamma_{\ell m}$. This expansion together with its inverse
is
%
% Hu04 (A10), van de Rijt PhD (6.32)
%
\begin{align}
  (\gamma_1 \pm {\rm i} \gamma_2)(\theta, \varphi) = & \sum_{\ell m} \,\, _{\pm 2}\gamma_{\ell m} \; _{\pm 2}\!{\rm Y}_{\ell m}(\theta, \varphi);
  \label{eq:gamma_harm_exp}
    \\
  \, _2 \gamma_{\ell m} = & \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} {\rm d} \Omega \, \gamma(\theta, \varphi) \;  _2\!{\rm Y}^\ast_{\ell m}(\theta, \varphi);
    \nonumber \\
  \, _{-2} \gamma_{\ell m} = & \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} {\rm d} \Omega \, \gamma^\ast(\theta, \varphi) \,  _{-2}\!{\rm Y}^\ast_{\ell m}(\theta, \varphi).
  \label{eq:gamma_harm_exp_inv}
\end{align}
%
The spin-weighted spherical harmonics $_s\!{\rm Y}_{\ell m}$ that are the basis function
in the expansion of the shear (\ref{eq:gamma_harm_exp}) can be calculated via the relations
%
% Rijt (6.16); BBRV12 (9)
%
\begin{align}
  \ellbar(\ell, s) \; _s\!{\rm Y}_{\ell m}(\theta, \varphi) = & \edth^s {\rm Y}_{\ell m}(\theta, \varphi);
    \nonumber \\
  \ellbar(\ell, s) \; _{-s}\!{\rm Y}_{\ell m}(\theta, \varphi) = & (-1)^s \left(\edth^\ast\right)^s {\rm Y}_{\ell m}(\theta, \varphi),
  \label{eq:sYlm_def} 
\end{align}
%
with the spin prefactor \citep{2012PhRvD..86b3001B}
%
\begin{equation}
  \ellbar(\ell, s) = \sqrt{\frac{(\ell + s)!}{(\ell - s)!}}.
  \label{eq:ellbar}
\end{equation} 
%
Inserting the lensing potential expansion (\ref{eq:psi_harm_exp}) into the
expression for the shear (\ref{gamma_psi_spher}), and using (\ref{eq:sYlm_def})
to compute the derivatives, we find for the shear expansion coefficients
\citep{2000PhRvD..62d3007H,2001astro.ph.11605T}
%
% Rijt after (7.5); Taylor01 (18); Hu00 (A10)
%
\begin{equation}
  _{\pm 2} \gamma_{\ell m} = \frac 1 2 \ellbar(\ell, 2) \psi_{\ell m}.
  \label{eq:gamma_ellm_phi_ellm}
\end{equation}
%
The two coefficients $_{+2} \gamma_{\ell m}$ and $_{-2} \gamma_{\ell m}$ are
identical since the potential $\phi$ is a real function.

The tomographic shear power spectrum, in analogy to (\ref{eq:C_ell_phi_Pm}), is defined by
%
\begin{equation}
  \left\langle _2\gamma^{}_{\ell m, i} \; {}_2\gamma^\ast_{\ell^\prime m^\prime, j} \right\rangle
    = \delta_{\ell \ell^\prime} \delta_{m m^\prime} C^\gamma_{ij}(\ell).
  \label{eq:C_ell_gamma}
\end{equation}
%
For a flat Universe, this is given by
%
\begin{align}
  C^\gamma_{ij}(\ell) = \frac 1 4 \ellbar^2(\ell, 2) \, C^\psi_{ij}(\ell)
                 = & \frac 2 \pi \, \ellbar^2(\ell, 2) \, \pref^2
                 \int_{0}^{\chi_{\rm lim}} \frac{\rm d \chi}{\chi} \frac{q_i(\chi)}{a(\chi)}
                \int_{0}^{\chi_{\rm lim}} \frac{\rm d \chi^\prime}{\chi^\prime}
                \frac{q_j(\chi^\prime)}{a(\chi^\prime)}
                %\nonumber \\
                %& \times
                \int_0^\infty \frac{{\rm d} k}{k^2} \, P_{\rm m}(k, \chi, \chi^\prime) \,
                {\rm j}_\ell(k \chi) \, {\rm j}_\ell(k \chi^\prime) .
  \label{eq:C_ell_full}
\end{align}
%
The spherical prefactor for the full projection power spectrum is $p(\ell) :=
\ellbar^2(\ell, 2)$, which will be modified under flat-sky and Limber
approximations below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Convergence power spectrum}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The convergence is related to the lensing potential on the sphere via the
product of spin-raising and spin-lowering edth operators, which are identical
to the spherical Laplacian differential operator.

%
\begin{equation}
  \kappa(\theta, \varphi) = \frac 1 2 \edth \edth^\ast \psi(\theta, \varphi) = \frac 1 2 \nabla^2 \psi(\theta, \varphi).
  \label{eq:kappa_psi_spher}
\end{equation}
%
The spherical harmonics are eigenfunctions of the Laplacian,
%
\begin{equation}
  \nabla^2 {\rm Y}_{\ell m}(\theta, \varphi) = - \ell (\ell + 1) {\rm Y}_{\ell m}(\theta, \varphi)
    = - \ellbar^2(\ell, 1) {\rm Y}_{\ell m}(\theta, \varphi),
  \label{eq:nabla_Ylm}
\end{equation}
%
The convergence power spectrum is then similar to the shear power spectrum
(\ref{eq:C_ell_gamma}) with a different spherical prefactor,
%
\begin{equation}
  C^\kappa_{ij}(\ell) = \frac 1 4 \ellbar^4(\ell, 1) \, C^\psi_{ij}(\ell)
    = \frac{\ell (\ell+1)}{(\ell-1)(\ell+2)} C^\gamma_{ij}(\ell) .
  \label{eq:C_ell_kappa_full}
\end{equation}
%
The convergence power spectrum is thus larger than the shear power spectrum, by
10\% for $\ell=4$, 1\% for $\ell = 14$, and less than 0.1\% for $\ell>45$.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Flat-sky approximation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Most previous work has used lensing quantities approximated on a flat sky,
neglecting the sky curvature. This is a valid approach for past and current
survey areas that have extents up to 10 degrees or less. The correlation
functions from the observed shear have been calculated using spherical
coordinates, and the effect on large scales is not negligible \cite{FSHK08}.
Here we examine the effect of sky curvature on the theoretical models.

For a flat sky, the spherical harmonics expansions are approximated by Fourier
transforms. The flat-sky equivalent of eqs.~(\ref{eq:psi_harm_exp}) and
(\ref{eq:psi_harm_exp_inv}) are
%
\begin{align}
  \psi(\vec \vartheta) = & \int \frac{{\rm d}^2 \ell}{(2\pi)^2} \, {\rm e}^{-{\rm i} \vec \ell \vec \vartheta} \hat \psi(\vec \ell);
  \label{eq:psi_fourier}
  \\
  %
  \hat \psi(\vec \ell) = & \int {\rm d}^2 \vartheta \, {\rm e}^{{\rm i} \vec \ell \vec \vartheta} \psi(\vec \vartheta);
  \label{eq:psi_fourier_inv}
\end{align}
%
where $\vec \vartheta = (\theta, \varphi)$ is the vector describing a 2D angle on the sky.
Instead of a harmonics coefficients $\psi_{\ell m}$, the Fourier representation of the potential
$\hat \psi$ now depends on the vector $\vec \ell \in R^2$.

The power spectrum, the flat-sky version of
(\ref{eq:C_ell_psi}) is defined by
%
\begin{equation}
  \left\langle \hat \psi_i^{}(\vec \ell) \hat \psi_j^\ast(\vec \ell^\prime) \right\rangle
    = (2\pi)^2 \delta_{\rm D}(\vec \ell - \vec \ell^\prime) P^\psi_{ij}(\ell).
  \label{eq:P_ell_psi}
\end{equation}


\mk{I can derive a flat-sky shear power spectrum by replacing $\ellbar^2(\ell, 2)$ with $\ell^4$
in (\ref{eq:C_ell_full}), equivalent to replacing the edth operators with Euclidian derivatives.
However, this results in a different expression compared to other references, e.g.~\cite{2008PhRvD..78d3002S},
which is the following equation.}

The flat-sky power spectrum is
%
\begin{align}
  P_{ij}^\gamma(\ell) = & \frac 2 \pi \, \pref^2
                 \int_{0}^{\chi_{\rm lim}} {\rm d} \chi \chi \, \frac{q_i(\chi)}{a(\chi)}
                \int_{0}^{\chi_{\rm lim}} {\rm d} \chi^\prime\, \chi^\prime
                \frac{q_j(\chi^\prime)}{a(\chi^\prime)}
                \nonumber \\
                & \times \int_0^\infty {\rm d} k \, k^2 \, P_{\rm m}(k; \chi, \chi^\prime) \,
                {\rm j}_\ell(k \chi) \, {\rm j}_\ell(k \chi^\prime) .
  \label{eq:P_ell_gamma}
\end{align}
%

\mk{I can get this by placing the prefactor under the integral and
setting $\ell^4 = k^4 \chi^2 {\chi^\prime}^2$. This does not seem to be the proper way.
Other derivations of the shear power spectrum (e.g.\cite{BS01} also assume other approximations
such as small-angle and Limber, but I do not know how to derive this without Limber.}


\section{Second-order Limber approximation for weak lensing}
\label{sec:L2}

\subsection{Spherical case}

We follow \cite{2008PhRvD..78l3506L} who derive the second-order Limber
expansion for general projections from 3D to 2D scalar fields in the spherical,
all-sky case. First, we use the identity of Bessel functions
%
\begin{equation}
  {\rm j}_\ell(x) = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2x}} {\rm J}_{\ell + 1/2}(x)
\end{equation}
%
in eq.~(\ref{eq:C_ell_full}), where ${\rm J}_\ell$ is the first-kind Bessel
function of order $\ell$. Next, \cite{2008PhRvD..78l3506L} solve integrals of
the form
%
\begin{equation}
  \int_0^\infty {\rm d} \chi f(\chi) {\rm J}_{\ell + 1/2}(k \chi)
  = \int_0^\infty {\rm d} x k^{-1} f(x/k) {\rm J}_{\ell + 1/2}(x)
  \label{eq:int_dchi}
\end{equation}
%
by performing a Taylor expansion of the function $f$ around $x = k \chi = \nu$, where
the Bessel function has its approximate maximum.

\subsubsection{Geometric mean cross-correlation power spectrum}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To separate the $k$- and $\chi, \chi^\prime$-terms in (\ref{eq:C_ell_full}), we
first approximate the matter power cross-spectrum between two distances as
geometric mean of the two involved distances \cite{2005PhRvD..72b3516C,2016arXiv161200770K},
%
\begin{equation}
 P_{\rm m}(k; \chi, \chi^\prime) = \sqrt{ P_{\rm m}(k; \chi) P_{\rm m}(k; \chi^\prime) }
  \label{eq:P_geom_mean}
\end{equation}
%
With this, eq.~(\ref{eq:C_ell_full}) is written as
%
\begin{align}
  C^\gamma_{ij}(\ell) \approx & \, \ellbar^2(\ell, 2) \, \pref^2
                \int_0^\infty \frac{{\rm d} k}{k^3} \,
                % P_{\rm m}(k) \,
                \int_{0}^\infty \frac{{\rm d} \chi}{\chi^{3/2}} \sqrt{P_{\rm m}(k; \chi)}
                \frac{q_i(\chi)}{a(\chi)} {\rm J}_{\ell+1/2}(k \chi)
                \nonumber \\
                 & \times
                \int_{0}^\infty \frac{{\rm d} \chi^\prime}{{\chi^\prime}^{3/2}}
                \sqrt{P_{\rm m}(k; \chi^\prime)} \frac{q_j(\chi^\prime)}{a(\chi^\prime)} {\rm J}_{\ell+1/2}(k \chi^\prime)
  \label{eq:C_ell_full_Pk}
\end{align}
%
We replaced the upper limits of the distance integral with infinity. \mk{Comment on this.}
Note that this equation has a preactor $\ellbar^2(\ell, 2)$ corresponding to a spin-2 field, in contrast
to \cite{2008PhRvD..78l3506L} who show calculations for a scalar field.

Following \cite{2008PhRvD..78l3506L} we expand to third order
%
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0} \int_0^\infty {\rm d} x \, {\rm e}^{-\epsilon (x - \nu)} g(x) {\rm J}_\nu(x)
  %\approx g(\nu) - \frac 1 2 g^{\prime\prime}(\nu) - \frac \nu 6 g^{\prime\prime\prime}(\nu) 
  \approx g(\nu) - \frac 1 2 \left.\frac{{\rm d}^2 g}{{\rm d} x^2}\right|_{x=\nu}
                 - \frac \nu 6 \left.\frac{{\rm d}^3 g}{{\rm d} x^3}\right|_{x=\nu} ,
\end{equation}
%
with $g(x) = k^{-1} f(k, \chi)$, $\chi=x/k$, and its derivatives $g^{(n)}(x) =
k^{-1-n} f^{(n)}(k, \chi)$ for a given $k$. In our case the projection kernel is
%
\begin{equation}
  f(k, \chi) = \sqrt{P_{\rm m}(k; \chi)} \, a^{-1}(\chi) \chi^{-3/2} q(\chi).
  \label{eq:f_LA08}
\end{equation}
%
(Add indices $i, j$ to $f$ and $q$ for the tomographic case.)
%
Replacing both distance integrals in (\ref{eq:C_ell_full_Pk}) by their Taylor-expansions around $\nu = k \chi$ and $\nu = k \chi^\prime$,
respectively, yields
%
\begin{align}
  C^\gamma_{ij}(\ell) \approx & \, \ellbar^2(\ell, 2) \, \pref^2
    \int_0^\infty \frac{{\rm d} k}{k^3} \, k^{-2}
    \left[ f_i(k, \chi) - \frac{1}{2 k^2} f_i^{\prime\prime}(k, \chi)
      - \frac{\nu}{6 k^3} f_i^{\prime\prime\prime}(k, \chi) + \ldots \right]
    %\nonumber \\
    %& \times
    \left[ f_j(k, \chi) - \frac{1}{2 k^2} f_j^{\prime\prime}(k, \chi)
    - \frac{\nu}{6 k^3} f_j^{\prime\prime\prime}(k, \chi) + \ldots \right]
  \label{eq:C_ell_limber2_dk}
\end{align}
%
Changing the integration to $\chi = \nu/k$ and collecting terms according to their $\nu$-dependence:
%
\begin{align}
  C^\gamma_{ij}(\ell) \approx & \, C^\gamma_{{\rm L1}, ij}(\ell) + C^\gamma_{{\rm L2}, ij}(\ell)
      \nonumber \\
    = & \frac{\ellbar^2(\ell, 2)}{\nu^4} \, \pref^2
    \int_0^\infty {\rm d} \chi \, \chi^3 \, % P_{\rm m}\left( k \right)
    %\Bigg\{
    \left\{
    (f_i f_j)(\nu/\chi, \chi)
    %\right.
      %\nonumber \\
    %&
    %\left.
     - \frac 1 {\nu^2} \left[ \frac{\chi^2}{2} \left( f^{}_i f^{\prime\prime}_j + f_i^{\prime\prime} f^{}_j \right)(\nu/\chi, \chi)
    + \frac{\chi^3}{6} \left( f^{}_i f^{\prime\prime\prime}_j + f^{\prime\prime\prime}_i f^{}_j \right)(\nu/\chi, \chi)
    \right]
    \right\}
    %\Bigg\}
  \label{eq:C_ell_limber12_dr}
\end{align}
%
The first term corresponds to the well-known first-order Limber approximation
\cite{1953ApJ...117..134L,1992ApJ...388..272K}, which is very widely used in
weak gravitational lensing. We retrieve the (spherical) standard expression by
inserting back the projection kernel (\ref{eq:f_LA08}) and the time-dependent
power spectrum,
%
\begin{align}
  C^\gamma_{{\rm L1}, ij}(\ell) = & \, \frac{\ellbar^2(\ell, 2)}{\nu^4} \, \pref^2 \int {\rm d} \chi \frac{ q_i(\chi) q_j(\chi) }{a^2(\chi)}
  P_{\rm m}\left(\frac{\nu}{\chi}; \chi\right).
  \label{eq:C_ell_limber1}
\end{align}
%
In the Limber approximation, modes between structures at different epochs do
not contribute to the single line-of-sight integration.

The second-order Limber term in (\ref{eq:C_ell_limber12_dr}) has an additional
$\nu^{-2}$-dependence, and is therefore strongly suppressed for large $\ell$.
%
\begin{align}
  C^\gamma_{{\rm L2}, ij}(\ell) = & - \frac 1 {\nu^2} \, \frac{\ellbar^2(\ell, 2)}{\nu^4} \, \pref^2
    \int {\rm d} \chi \, \chi^{2} a^{-2} \sqrt{P_{\rm m}\left(\frac\nu\chi; \chi\right)}
    %\nonumber \\
    %& \times
    \frac{a(\chi)}{2} \chi^{3/2} \left[ q^{}_i f^{\prime\prime}_j + f^{\prime\prime}_i q^{}_j
      + \frac{\chi}{3} \left( q^{}_i f^{\prime\prime\prime}_j + f^{\prime\prime\prime}_i q^{}_j
      \right)
    \right](\nu/\chi, \chi)
  \label{eq:C_ell_limber2_dr} 
\end{align}
%
The higher-order derivatives of the filter functions have to be computed
numerically in the general case. These suffer from numerical noise and are
sensitive to the set-up, for example the step size. The tabulation and
interpolation of those derivatives is time-taking since they depend on two
arguments, $\nu$ and $\chi$. In the following section, we will separate the
$k$- and $\chi$-dependend parts of the power spectrum to make the numerical
derivatives faster and more smooth.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Time-independent power spectrum separation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To further develop (\ref{eq:P_geom_mean}), we divide out the growth factor to
define a redshift-independent power spectrum $P_{\rm m}(k)$,
%
\begin{equation}
 P_{\rm m}(k, \chi) =: D_+(\chi) P_{\rm m}(k).
  \label{eq:P_k_chi_sep_s}
\end{equation}
%
This is not exact, since some non-linear prescriptions of the power spectrum
depend on redshift other than the growth factor, for example when computing the
non-linear scale $k_{\rm NL}(z)$ for \texttt{halofit}.

With this approximation, the $k$-independent term factors out from
(\ref{eq:f_LA08}), and we define the separated kernel function $f_{\rm s}$ as
%
\begin{equation}
  f_{\rm s}(\chi) = D_+(\chi) a^{-1}(\chi) \chi^{-3/2} q(\chi).
  \label{eq:f_LA08_s}
\end{equation}
%
and does not need to be considered when taking the derivatives with respect to comoving distances.
The second-order Limber term of the shear power spectrum can then be simplified to
%
\begin{align}
  C^\gamma_{{\rm L2}, ij}(\ell) = & - \frac 1 {\nu^2} \, \frac{\ellbar^2(\ell, 2)}{\nu^4} \, \pref^2
    \int {\rm d} \chi \, \chi^{2} a^{-2} P_{\rm m}\left(\frac\nu\chi; \chi\right)
    %\nonumber \\
    %& \times
    \frac {a(\chi)}{2 D_+(\chi)} \chi^{3/2}
    \left[ q^{}_i f^{\prime\prime}_{{\rm s} j} + f^{\prime\prime}_{{\rm s}i} q^{}_j
      + \frac{\chi}{3} \left( q^{}_i f^{\prime\prime\prime}_{{\rm s}j} + f^{\prime\prime\prime}_{{\rm s}i} q^{}_j
      \right)
    \right](\chi)
  \label{eq:C_ell_limber2_dr_s}
\end{align}
%
We compute the numerical higher derivatives as follows. The functions $f_{\rm
s}(\chi)$ are fitted as power laws with index $\approx 1.5$. The fit is
performed between $\chi_{\rm min} = 0.001 {\rm Mpc}/h$ and $\chi_{\rm max} =
500 \mbox{Mpc}/h$. At larger comoving distances the kernel decreases faster
than a power law, so we exclude this range from the fit. Even though the
derivaties are larger due to the steeper decline, the associated errors are
very small since those scales are down-weighed by the kernel function $f_{\rm
s}$ itself. At $\chi = 500 \mbox{Mpc}/h$ the filter function is less than
$10^{-4}$ of its value of unity at Mpc$/h$.

%The error between filter and power-law fit
%becomes larger than $50\%$ only for scales larger than $1,500 \mbox{Mpc}/h$. On the angular
%scales where the second-order Limber approximation significantly contributes to the shear
%power spectrum, $\ell \le 100$, this corresponds to $k < 0.03 h/$Mpc, linear
%scales where the 3D power spectrum is small and does not strongly contribute to the lensing
%power spectrum.

\subsection{Flat sky}
\label{sec:Limber_flat_sky}

The extended flat-sky Limber approximation is readily derived from the
spherical case, by replacing the prefactor $\ellbar^2(\ell, 2)$ with $\ell^4$,
%
\begin{align}
  P^\gamma_{{\rm L1}, ij}(\ell) = & \, \frac{\ell^4}{\nu^4} \, \pref^2 \int {\rm d} \chi \frac{ q_i(\chi) q_j(\chi) }{a^2(\chi)}
  P_{\rm m}\left(k = \frac{\nu}{\chi}; \chi\right);
  \label{eq:P_ell_limber1}
  \\
    P^\gamma_{{\rm L2}, ij}(\ell) = & - \frac 1 {\nu^2} \, \frac{\ell^4}{\nu^4} \, \pref^2
    \int {\rm d} \chi \, \chi^{2} a^{-2} P_{\rm m}\left(k = \frac\nu\chi; \chi\right)
    %\nonumber \\
    %& \times
    \frac{a(\chi)}{2 D^{-1}_+(\chi)} \chi^{3/2} \left[ q^{}_i f^{\prime\prime}_{{\rm s}j} + f^{\prime\prime}_{{\rm s}i} q^{}_j  
      + \frac{\chi}{3} \left( q^{}_i f^{\prime\prime\prime}_{{\rm s}j} + f^{\prime\prime\prime}_{{\rm s}i} q^{}_j
      \right)
    \right](\chi)
  \label{eq:P_ell_limber2}
\end{align}
%
Different further approximations are commonly made for the prefactor $p(\ell) = \ell^4/\nu^4$ and $\nu(\ell)$:
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $p(\ell) = 1$, this corresponds to $\nu(\ell) = \ell$, which is the \emph{standard} Limber approximation.
    Until recently, i.e.~for all pre-2014 CFHTlenS results, this was the approximation of choice.
  \item $p(\ell) = \ell^4/(\ell + 1/2)^4$. This corresponds to the \emph{extended} Limber
    approximation with $\nu(\ell) = \ell + 1/2$; however the following case is typically employed:
  \item $p(\ell) = 1$, but as the argument of the 3D power spectrum $\nu = \ell + 1/2$. This is
    a \emph{hybrid} between
    standard and extended Limber approximation, and was used in \cite{KiDS-450,joudaki/etal:2016}. As is shown
    later, this is a much better approximation to the full projection than case (ii).

\subsection{Comparison of the approximations for the lensing power spectrum}
\label{sec:comp}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In Fig.~\ref{fig:Cl_cases} we plot the full spherical projection of the shear
power spectrum in comparison to shear power spectra derived assuming the range
of different approximations listed in Table \ref{tab:cases}.  The adopted
redshift distribution corresponds to CFHTLenS \cite{CFHTLenS-2pt-notomo} and we
assume their best-fit flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $\Omega=0.279$,
$\Omega_b=0.046$, $\sigma_8=0.70$, $H_0=0.701$, $n_s=0.96$. For $\ell > 100$ we
find that all shear power spectra predictions agree with the full spherical
solution to better than one percent, with the majority of the approximations
tested accurate to better than 0.1 per cent.   

Considering first the flat-sky cases, the standard first-order Limber
approximation (L1Fl), that was adopted for all pre-2014 CFHTLenS analyses, we
find to be accurate to better than 10\% for $\ell>3$, converging slowly to the
true projection with percent level precison at $\ell>100$. For the extended
Limber approximations `hybrid' cases (ExtL1FlHyb and ExtL2FlHyb), despite
decreased accuracy for $\ell < 8$ in comparison to the standard first-order
Limber case, the errors with respect to the true power spectrum decrease much
faster, as $\ell^{-2}$, such that percent-level precision is reached at
$\ell>15$.  The first-order extended Limber approximation `hybrid' case
(ExtL1FlHyb) was adopted by both \citet{joudaki/etal:2016} and
\cite{KiDS-450}\footnote{We confirm that there is a typographical error in
equation 4 of \cite{KiDS-450} which should include the extra term of `+0.5' in
$\nu(\ell)$ that was incorporated in the cosmological analysis.} 

The outlier in the flat-sky cases is the extended Limber approximation
(ExtL1Fl) which performs relatively poorly, and reach 10\% precision only at
$\ell > 100$. To our knowledge this form of the flat-sky approximation has not
been used in cosmic shear studies to date. The same slow convergence can be
observed for the corresponding second-order flat case, ExtL2Fl.

Including the spherical prefactor (the case ExtL1Sph) decreases the difference
by a factor of a few for $\ell < 5$. Going to second-order (ExtL2Sph) yields
percent accuracy down to $\ell = 4$.

\mk{Not sure whether this following paragraph should be left in the draft: One
notes that the difference between the full projection and second-order Limber
does not scale as expected with $\ell^{-4}$, but rather with $\ell^{-2}$. This
might be due to numerical noise that creates residual terms at the ${\cal
O}(\ell^{-2})$ which do not cancel. Also note that the numerical noise for
$\ell > 20$ is due to numerical integration errors for the full projection.}

\subsection{Effects on the shear correlation function}
\label{sec:comp_xi}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



Most cosmic shear analysis to date have been performed on real-space
correlation statistics, since these can be measured direcaly from an observed
galaxy shape catalogue. The basic quantity is the two-point correlation
function \citep{miraldaescude:1991}, which is given by
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \xi_+(\theta) 
  % &
  = \frac 1 {2\pi} \int {\rm d} \ell \, \ell {\rm J}_0(\ell
   \theta)
  P^\gamma(\ell);
  \quad
  %\nonumber \\
   %
   \xi_-(\theta)
  %&
  = \frac 1 {2\pi} \int
   {\rm d} \ell \, \ell {\rm J}_4(\ell \theta)
  P^\gamma(\ell).
  %
   \label{eqn:xiGG}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where ${\rm J}_\nu$ first-kind Bessel function of order $\nu$. The flat-sky
shear power spectrum $P^\gamma$ an be related to the underlying matter power
spectrum through equation \ref{eq:P_ell_limber1} when adopting a first-order
extended Limber approximation, or equation~\ref{eq:P_ell_limber2} when adopting
a second-order extended Limber approximation \citep[for more details see][and
references therein]{miraldaescude:1991, kaiser:1992,
bartelmann/schneider:2001}.

On a sphere, correlation functions cannot be related to the power spectrum by a
Hankel transform in equation~\ref{eqn:xiGG}, as the spherical power spectrum is
formally not defined for non-integer $\ell$ \citep[see][for alternative
spherical-sky formulae for the two-point correlation
function]{2005PhRvD..72b3516C}. In particular, the spherical Bessel functions
necessary to compute the full projection (\ref{eq:C_ell_full}) is defined only
for integer order $\ell$. \mk{Is this really true?}

However, in the Limber approximations the Bessel functions expanded to by
polynomials, allowing for arbitrary wave modes $\ell$. The spherical prefactor
$\ellbar(\ell, 2)$ (\ref{eq:ellbar}) can be generalised to non-integer
arguments and is positive for $\ell \le 2$. We can thus use the spherical power
spectrum in the Limber approximations for the Hankel transformation to compute
the two-point correlation functions, This is not entirely consistent, but
serves the purpose of comparison to the flat-sky case.

In addition, as we have shown in section~\ref{sec:comp} that the spherical
second-order extended Limber approximation provides a percent-level precision
representation of the full spherical projection for $\ell > 3$, we do not
present predictions for the two-point shear correlation function using the full
spherical projection, instead choosing the spherical second-order extended
Limber approximation (Ext2Sph) as our \mk{reference} in this case.

Figure.~\ref{fig:xi_pm_K16} presents the two-point correlation functions
$\xi_+$ (left) and $\xi_-$ (right) using the different cases for the shear
power spectrum listed in Table~\ref{tab:cases}. The adopted CFHTLenS redshift
distribution and fiducial cosmological model are the same as in
Figure.~\ref{fig:Cl_cases}. As is clear by the red dotted curve, using the
Planck cosmology \citep{2015arXiv150201589P} induces a much larger change in
the amplitude of the shear correlation function than the different projection
methods.

\subsubsection{Lensing potential power spectrum}

To obtain the power spectrum of the lensing potential for a flat Universe, 
we insert the lensing projection (\ref{eq:psi}) for $K=0$ into the
inverse harmonics expansion (\ref{eq:psi_harm_exp_inv}) and write the 3D potential
as its Fourier transform (\ref{eq:hatPhi_inv}) to get
%
\begin{equation}
  \psi_{\ell m} = \frac 2 {c^2} \int {\rm d} \Omega {\rm Y}^\ast_{\ell m}(\theta, \varphi)
    \int_0^{\chi_{\rm lim}} \frac{{\rm d}\chi}{\chi} q(\chi) \int \frac{{\rm d}^3 k}{(2\pi)^3} \hat \Phi(\vec k; \chi) {\rm e}^{-{\rm i} \vec k \vec r}.
\end{equation}
%
The 3D position vector $\vec r$ is a 3D position vector with polar coordinate
$r = \chi$ and polar angles $(\theta, \varphi)$. Similarly we denote with
$\theta_k, \varphi_k$ the polar angles of the 3D Fourier vector $\vec k$. We
insert the expansion of a plane wave into spherical harmonics,

\begin{equation}
  {\rm e}^{{\rm i} \vec k \vec r} = 4 \pi \sum_{\ell=0}^{\infty} \sum_{m=-\ell}^{\ell}

    {\rm Y}_{\ell m}(\theta, \varphi) {\rm Y}_{\ell m}(\theta_k, \varphi_k) .

  \label{eq:Yellm_ortho}
\end{equation}
%
the expression for $\psi_{\ell m}$ simplifies to
%
\begin{equation}
  \psi_{\ell m} = \frac {{\rm i}^\ell}{c^2 \pi^2} \int_0^{\chi_{\rm lim}} \frac{{\rm d}\chi}{\chi} q(\chi) \int {\rm d}^3 k \,

  \label{eq:psi_ellm}
\end{equation}
%
We take the absolute square and use the definition of the 3D potential power spectrum (\ref{eq:p_phi}),
to arrive at expression (\ref{eq:C_ell_phi_Pphi}).

$P_{\rm m}$ is the 3D matter power cross-spectrum at line-of-sight comoving
Fourier mode $k$ and comoving distances $\chi$ and $\chi^\prime$. We denote
complex conjugation with superscript $^\ast$.
\mk{Peter's comment: What does the correlation between two epochs actually mean if they
are not on the backward light cone?}

The delta-function resolves one 3D Fourier
integral. We split the second integration into radial and spherical
coordinates, ${\rm d}^3 k = {\rm d} k k^2 {\rm d} \Omega_k$ and use once again
the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics to resolve the spherical integral. 
This leads to the potential power spectrum (\ref{eq:C_ell_phi_Pm}).

\subsection{Kitching et al.~2016}

\cite{2016arXiv161104954K} compute the full projection of the weak-lensing power
spectrum, which they present as spherical-radial representation the 3D shear field.
Our results (\ref{eq:C_ell_full}) correspond to their equations (7) and (8)
for a flat Universe and in the case of perfect
photometric redshifts, $p(z | z_{\rm p}) = \delta_{\rm D}(z - z_{\rm p})$, and
for a bin function that selects the redshift bin $i$, $W^{\rm SR}(z, z_{\rm p})
= 1_{z \in i-\mbox{th bin}}$. In \cite{2016arXiv161104954K} eq.~(7) is however the
factor $2/\pi$ missing.

In App.~A \cite{2016arXiv161104954K} derives the spherical and extended
Limber approximation starting from the full spherical projection. Note that
their filter function $q$ defined in (31) has an errornous factor of comoving
distance $r$, and an additional factor $\pi/2$ appears. \mk{This is probably worded
too strongly.}

We can not reproduce the amplitude of the differences between the cases,
neither for the power spectrum nor for the shear correlation function (see
Figs.~\ref{fig:Cl_cases} and \ref{fig:xi_pm_K16}).


\paragraph{Bernardeau, Bonvin, Van de Rijt, Vernizzi (2012); van de Rijt (2012)}

Eq.~(44) of \cite{2012PhRvD..86b3001B} is the non-tomographic $C(\ell)$ in
terms of the time-independent potential power spectrum $T^2(k) P(k)$, where $T$
is the transfer function; the growth factor $D$ is contained in their window
function $W$ (43) as growth-suppression factor $g(\chi) = D(\chi)/a(\chi)$
(defined after eq.~{24}). For a single source redshift, we find the identity
$W(\chi)$ = $q(\chi)\chi^{-1} D(\chi) a^{-1}(\chi)$.
\cite{2012PhRvD..86b3001B} is consistent with our
(\ref{eq:C_ell_full}), if we interpret the
scale factors at distances $\chi$ and $\chi^\prime$, respectively.

The PhD thesis of Van de Rijt \cite{vande2012} presents an explicit calculation
of the second-order Limber approximation for a fixed source redshift. They
carry out the derivatives of the kernels $f$ under the assumption of a constant
growth-suppression factor $D_+(a)/a$, and a power spectrum that separates $k$-
from $\chi$-terms. We show the consistency between their result (eq.~7.19) and
our (\ref{eq:C_ell_limber2_dr_s}), as follows.

We write (\ref{eq:C_ell_limber2_dr_s}) without tomography, and insert again the
time-independent power spectrum (\ref{eq:P_geom_mean}),
%
\begin{align}
  C^\gamma_{{\rm L2}}(\ell) = & - \frac 1 {\nu^2} \, \frac{\ellbar^2(\ell, 2)}{\nu^4} \, \pref^2
    \int {\rm d} \chi \, \chi^{2} P_{\rm m}\left(k = \frac\nu\chi\right)
    \nonumber \\
    & \times D_+(\chi) a^{-1}(\chi) \chi^{3/2} q(\chi) \left[ f^{\prime\prime} 
      + \frac{\chi}{3} f^{\prime\prime\prime} 
    \right](\chi)
  \label{eq:C_ell_limber2_dr_notomo}
\end{align}
%
For a fixed source comoving distance $\chi_{\rm S}$ the lensing efficiency is
$q(\chi) = (\chi_{\rm S} - \chi) \chi_{\rm S}^{-1}$. Assuming that
$D_+(\chi)/a(\chi) \approx g = \mbox{const}$, we get for the derivative terms,
with $f(\chi) = g \chi_{\rm S}^{-1} (\chi_{\rm S} - \chi) \chi^{-3/2}$,
%
\begin{equation}
  f^{\prime\prime}(\chi) + \frac{\chi}{3} f^{\prime\prime\prime}(\chi)
    = - \frac 1 8 \chi^{-5/2} \left( \frac 5 \chi
          + \frac 1 {\chi_{\rm S}} \right) \frac{D_+(\chi)}{a(\chi)}.
\end{equation}
%
Therefore,
%
\begin{align}
  C^\gamma_{{\rm L2}}(\ell) = \frac 1 {\nu^2} \, \frac{\ellbar^2(\ell, 2)}{\nu^4} \, \pref^2
    \int {\rm d} \chi \, \chi \, P_{\rm m}\left(k = \frac\nu\chi\right)
    \frac{q(\chi)}{8} \left( \frac 5 \chi + \frac 1 {\chi_{\rm S}} \right)
      \left(\frac{D_+(\chi)}{a(\chi)}\right)^2 
\end{align}
%
We now replace the matter with the potential power spectrum, ${\cal A}^2 P_{\rm m}(k) = k^{4} a^2 P_\Phi(k)$, and pull into the integral $\nu^{-4} = \chi^{-4} k^{-4}$. This yields
%
\begin{align}
  C^\gamma_{{\rm L2}}(\ell) = \frac 1 {\nu^2} \, \ellbar^2(\ell, 2)
    \int \frac{{\rm d} \chi}{\chi^2} \, P_\Phi\left(k = \frac\nu\chi\right)
    a^2(\chi) \frac{1}{8} \frac{\chi_{\rm S} - \chi}{\chi \chi_{\rm S}}
    \left( \frac 5 \chi + \frac 1 {\chi_{\rm S}} \right)
      \left(\frac{D_+(\chi)}{a(\chi)}\right)^2 .
\end{align}
%
Note the additional factor $a^2(\chi)$. This difference is accounted for by the
factor $a^{-1}$ in the propagation of primordial potential perturbations to
late times, see eq.~(6.22) in \cite{vande2012}, where the transition is done
using $g(a)$ instead of $D(a)$. \mk{Check this further.}


In Fig.~\ref{fig:L1L2E_Rijt} we reproduce Fig.~7.3 from \cite{vande2012} using
a similar set up (flat $\Lambda$ Universe with $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.3, h=0.65,
\Omega_{\rm b} = 0.0461, \sigma_8 = 0.8, n_{\rm s} = 0.96$. All source galaxies
are at redshift $z_{\rm S} = 1$. The non-linear 3D matter power spectrum from
\cite{2012ApJ...761..152T} is used. The ratio of the first-and second- Limber approximated
power spectra to the full
projection shows excellent agreement at the sub-percent level.

\paragraph{LoVerde \& Afshordi (2009)}

This paper introduces the extended Limber approximation to second order that we
apply in this work. Although they present the specific case of 2D galaxy
clustering, their calculations are general enough to apply to weak lensing.

Their eq.~(5) is a general spherical power spectrum of a scalar field,
projected from 3D to 2D via (4). Comparing their expressions with the
weak-lensing potential (\ref{eq:psi}), we can set $F_A(\chi) = F_B(\chi) = 2
c^{-2} D_+(\chi) q(\chi) \chi^{-1}$. With that, their eq.~(5) is identical to
our (\ref{eq:C_ell_phi_Pphi}).

The second-order Limber approximation in \cite{2008PhRvD..78l3506L} is presented in
eq.~(12). This is consistent with our first-order (\ref{eq:C_ell_limber1}) and
second-order (\ref{eq:C_ell_limber2_dr}) Limber approximation, when accounting for the difference between
lensing potential and shear 2D power spectrum, and 3D potential and matter power spectrum.


\paragraph{Schmidt (2009)}

In eq.~(9) \cite{2008PhRvD..78d3002S} write the lensing power spectrum in the
flat-sky limit. The Poisson factor $D_\phi$ is defined in their eq.~(5), see
also our eq.~\ref{eq:poisson}, and $D_{\rm m}$ is the growth factor. The filter
function $W_\kappa$ (eq.~10) can be written as
%
\begin{align}
  W_\kappa(z) = & \frac 1 {H(z)} \int_z^\infty {\rm d} z_{\rm s} W_{\rm L}(z_{\rm s}, z) W_{\rm g}(z)
              =  \frac 1 {H(z)} \chi \int_\chi^\infty {\rm d} \chi^\prime \frac{\chi^\prime - \chi}{\chi^\prime}
                n(\chi)
              \nonumber \\
              & \equiv \frac 1 {H(z)} \chi q(\chi),
\end{align}
%
using ${\rm d} z W_{\rm g}(z) = {\rm d} \chi n(\chi)$.
To write the redshift integrals (9) in \cite{2008PhRvD..78d3002S} over 
comoving distance, we make the variable transformation
%
\begin{equation}
  {\rm d} \chi = \frac{c {\rm d} z}{H(z)} .
\end{equation}
%
We recover our (\ref{eq:P_ell_gamma}).

\paragraph{Giannantonio et al. (2012)}

In eqs.~(25) and (26) \cite{2012MNRAS.422.2854G} write the flat-sky lensing
power spectrum. Their window function $W^{\varepsilon_i}$ defined in (25) for a
flat Universe equals $\pref \times q(\chi) / a(\chi)$, since ${\rm d} z {\rm d}
N(z)/{\rm d} z = {\rm d} \chi n(\chi)$; however there is a factor $r_K[r(z)]$
missing in the window function, which translates into a missing $r_K[r]
r_K[r^\prime]$ in the integral\footnote{Confirmed by T.~G., priv.~comm.}. This
also leads to an errorous $r_K^{-2}(r)$ in the Limber equation (27). With these
factors accounted for, we reproduce the expressions of \cite{2012MNRAS.422.2854G}.
