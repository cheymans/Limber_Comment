TODO for revised version (?)

- Fig. 2: Go to larger scales

- Check the a^2 factor for Van de Rijt.

- Start from Jacobian for propagation, not lensing potential

- Check series expansion of g

- s8 (Om/0.3)^0.5

- Check again a^2 in Van de Rijt, explanation with transition with D/a instead
  of D seems not correct.

Mir ist aufgefallen, dass ihr kappa aus den edth Auf- und Absteigeoperatoren
definiert habt… die kommutieren aber nicht auf der Kugel, oder? Ich dachte,
dass der sphaerische Laplace-Operator sich aus der Symmetrisierung edth edth^*
+ edth^* edth ergibt, und damit kappa aus dem Linsenpotenzial psi.

I just read your very nice paper on computing the weak lensing shear power
spectrum. You mention non-flat space in the conclusions, and how to generalise
your results to that case. I just wanted to let you know that we derived a
non-flat Limber approximation in appendix D of 1312.2697 if you are interested
in studying non-flat cosmologies in the future.

I was interested to see your paper recently posted to arXiv (1702.05301) on
cosmic shear power spectra. It looks very thorough, and I'll give it a read. I
thought I'd better alert you to an error in Equation 48 though. On the full sky
the relationship between the shear correlation functions and the power spectra
does not have a Legendre polynomial in the sum, rather it is a Wigner small-d
function. Specifically, for xi_+ you should replace P_l with d^l_{2,2} and for
xi_- it's d^l_{2,-2}. The form you have presented is only valid for spin-0
functions on the sphere.

I believe the standard references are Kamionkowski, Kosowsky & Stebbins 1997
(arxiv:9611125) and Ng & Liu 1999 (9710012), although neither explicitly
identifies their combinations of functions with the Wigner-d function. That
happens sometime between then and Chon et al. 2003 (0303414).

It's fairly straightforward to derive though - you take the the E/B-mode
expansion for the shear (Eq. 15 in your paper) and multiply it against its
complex conjugate. Taking the expectation value gives you the E-mode power
spectrum and kills the second (lm) sum, leaving you with sum_{l} C_l sum_{m}
2Y_{lm}(e1) 2Y_{lm}^*(e2) for a correlation between two points e1 and e2. Now
you can use the addition theorem for spin-weighted spherical harmonics (see
Wikipedia or the Varshalovich et al. textbook "Quantum Theory of Angular
Momentum") to replace the sum over $m$ with (2l+1)/4pi * D^l_{22}(g1,beta,g2),
where (g1,beta,g2) are the Euler angles rotating the polarization/shear basis
at e1 onto that at e2. Finally, defining the correlation function xi_+ as that
obtained by first rotating the local shear bases to be aligned with the
geodesic connecting the two points introduces two phase factors exp(2i*g1) and
exp(2i*g2). Then from the definition of the Wigner-reduced functions (Wikipedia
or Varshalovich or many others) we have D^l_{22}*exp(2i(g1+g2)) =
d^l_{22}(beta), where beta is the angle connecting e1 and e2. And similarly for
xi_-.
