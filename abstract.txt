We compute the spherical-sky weak-lensing power spectrum of the shear and
convergence. We discuss various approximations, such as flat-sky, and first-
and second- order Limber equations for the projection. We find that the impact
of adopting these approximations is negligible when constraining cosmological
parameters from current weak lensing surveys. This is demonstrated using data
from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). We find that
the reported tension with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature
anisotropy results cannot be al- leviated. For future large-scale surveys with
unprecedented precision, we show that the spherical second-order Limber
approximation will provide sufficient accuracy. In this case, the cosmic-shear
power spectrum is shown to be in agreement with the full projection at the
sub-percent level for l > 3, with the corresponding errors an order of
magnitude below cosmic variance for all l. When computing the two-point shear
correlation function, we show that the flat-sky fast Hankel transformation
results in errors below two percent compared to the full spherical
transformation. In the spirit of reproducible research, our numerical
implementation of all approximations and the full projection are publicly
available within the package nicaea at
